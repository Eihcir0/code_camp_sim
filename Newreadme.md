# Code Camp Sim
### (technical README below)

### Background

I'm a recent App Academy bootcamp grad and this was my final project.  My goal in creating this is to share my experience - intense, challenging, and rewarding.  

### Game vs. Real Life

- [ ] SLEEP: For me, managing sleep was the most important aspect of bootcamp.  In the game, as your sleep bank gets lower, it becomes more difficult to focus and harder not to fall asleep during the morning lectures.  (In reality, the lectures were very well done, but it was still difficult not to fall asleep during the end of the week!)

-[ ] HAPPINESS: We were all so focused on learning that it was difficult to
- [ ] Code snippets for "homework" and "assessments" evaluated through API calls to the REPL.IT server
- [ ] Users play mini-games such as: "don't fall asleep during lecture", "hyper tic-tac-toe", "myTowersOf Hanoi""pair-programming" and "debugger"
- [ ] Users can login, save status, and make post comments on the forums.

NOT IN REAL LIFE:

### Technologies & Technical Challenges

This simulation will be written mostly in React.js with some vanilla JavaScript components leveraging HTML5 Canvas.  The backend will be written in ruby on Rails with a SQLite database.  

The primary technical challenges will be:

- Planning simulation logic, which is still far from complete as of the writing of this document.
- Remembering how to create a backend in Rails.
- Remembering how to use React.js.
- Figuring out how to use the REPL.IT API.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1 Monday**: Continue planning and pseudocode for mini-games, game logic including class structure and components.  By the end of the day I should be ready to start coding.

**Day 2 Tuesday**:
I'm going to start with the main game loop logic completely in vanilla js.  Not writing any of the minigames this day.  By the end of the day, this should be a completed console log game (without the minigames)

**Day 3 Wednesday**:
Design the main screen and components for gameplay.  For now I will have buttons at the bottom that switch between Lecture / Pairs Programming / Assessments and Free Time.  By the end of the day I should have a main window component, with the center screen component, and a side bar.


**Day 4 Thursday**:
Write the lecture and open time logic and components.  

**Day 5 Friday**: Write the pair-programming minigame and debugger minigame.


**Day 6 Saturday**: Write Assessments minigame and debug.

**Day 7 Sunday**: Create backend, post to heroku.
